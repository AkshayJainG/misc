          [Parameter(Mandatory=$true)]
          [string]$Executable,
          [string]$User = 'Everyone'
    )

    if (-NOT (test-path $Executable)){
        Write-Host "[-] Executable not found or you do not have access to it. Exiting..."
        Return
        }

    if (-NOT (Get-WmiObject Win32_UserAccount -Filter "LocalAccount='true' and Name='$User'")){
        Write-Host "[-] User does not exist. Exiting..."
        Return
        }


    $AppLockerCheck = Get-AppLockerPolicy -Effective | Test-AppLockerPolicy -Path $Executable -User $User
    $AppLockerStatus = $AppLockerCheck | Select-String -InputObject {$_.PolicyDecision} -Pattern "Allowed"

    if ($AppLockerStatus -Match 'Allowed') { $Result = "[+] $Executable - ALLOWED for $User!" }
    else { $Result = "[-] $Executable - BLOCKED for $USER"}

    $Result
