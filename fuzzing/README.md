# fuzzing
Random stuff I use for fuzzing. Mostly AFL and Sulley.   

afl-build.sh - Script to setup my AFL test bench on an Ubuntu 16.04 VM. Will likely need to be tweaked if anyone else will use it.

afl-multi.sh - Script that creates 1 master and N slaves for single-system parallelization. Really useful for compute optimized AWS instances with tons of cores.
